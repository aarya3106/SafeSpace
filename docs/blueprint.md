# **App Name**: SafeSpace

## Core Features:

- Anonymous Onboarding: Allows users to create a session with an optional pseudonym, saving a device/session cookie and a UUID userId.
- AI Chatbot: An empathetic, adolescent-focused mental health assistant that uses tuned instruction prompts and grounding techniques. It will offer short grounding and breathing scripts, detect crisis/suicidality keywords, and escalate to counsellor booking with emergency resources and will use a tool to retrieve relevant system prompts and safe phrasings.
- Journaling: A digital diary with rich-text, mood tags, and optional private tags, offering auto-save drafts, search/filter by date & mood, and export/delete options. The backend encrypts user's entries.
- Relaxation & Noise Player: A player supporting white noise, pink noise, brown noise + relaxation sounds with timer, looping, crossfade, and pre-built breathing exercises with animated guides.
- Peer Support (Anonymous): Threaded posts with pseudonymous handles and topic tags, including moderation rules for flagged content and reporting/block features.
- Counsellor Connection & Bookings: Counsellor list (anonymized display name + available slots). Booking flow: choose counsellor, date, time; optional short note.
- Trackers: Schemas & UIs for sleep, activity, mood, nutrition & hydration, menstrual cycle (optional opt-in), and stress trackers.
